# About test project

I was given the task of developing a small project that is a To-do app. I should
demonstrate the following abilities/skills: make models, controllers, migrations, HTML, CSS, blade, Git commits, blade
templates, etc.

# Installation

1. After forking the app from  https://github.com/MarketingLoungePartnership/to-do-list I realised that
it is Laravel 9 app. For this reason, I made a couple of changes to use Vite. Because as you know
after Laravel 9, Vite is the default bundling package of Laravel instead of Laravel Mix.

2. `composer i`
3. `npm i`
4.
